# flux-template - An opinionated cluster agnostic Flux GitOps template repository

A lot of Flux template repositories expect you have already decided what type of Kubernetes distribution you want to use (i.e. the same one they are using). It works when you're following their design but it can be a pain when you even have a slighly different setup. This repository proposes the opposite approach, you know what core applications you want to run on your cluster, but you're not yet sure about the cluster infrastructure.

## Overview

This Flux template was created with a holistic but flexible view in mind. The repository structure is straightforward, easy to understand and easy to use. Still, every aspect is explained below:

### Stack

All core components are optional, you can choose to only use the repository structure as a starting point.

A fully set up repository structure is as follows:

### Top directories

- `apps`: user related deployments (e.g. webapps, game servers)
- `cluster`: Flux configuration
- `infrastructure`: common infrastructure components (e.g. monitoring, network)
- `templates`: yaml template files
- `tools`: workspace and template rendering

Flux is set up to only look at `apps`, `cluster` and `infrastructure`:

```
├── 📁 apps
│   └── kustomization.yaml
│  
├── 📁 cluster
│   ├── 📁 flux-system
│   ├── apps.yaml
│   └── infrastructure.yaml
|
└── 📁 infrastructure
    ├── 📁 configs
    ├── 📁 controllers
    ├── 📁 image-automations
    ├── 📁 notifications
    └── 📁 sources
```

#### Applications

The `apps` directory is very straightforward, you can structure it however you want as long as you mention the resource in the `kustomization.yaml` file.

#### Cluster

The `cluster` directory holds all the files necessary for Flux to work. The `flux-system` directory is generated after bootstrapping, the `apps.yaml` and `infrastructure.yaml` hold the Flux Kustomization definitions.

#### Infrastructure

The `infrastructure` is structured into 5 sub directories:

- `configs`: Kubernetes custom resources such as cert issuers and networks policies
- `controllers`: namespaces and Helm release definitions for Kubernetes controllers
- `image-automations`: [Image reflector and automation controllers](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/image/)
- `notifications`: [Notification Controllers](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/notification/)
- `sources`: [Source Controllers](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/source/)

The `configs`, `image-automations`, `notifications` directories have no resources by default. For brevity, they are omitted from the following view:

```
📁 infrastructure
├── 📁 controllers
│   ├── 📁 monitoring
|   ├── 📁 network
|   ├── 📁 upgrade
|   ├── reloader.yaml
|   └── kustomization.yaml
│  
└── 📁 sources
    ├── 📁 bucket
    ├── 📁 git
    ├── 📁 oci
    ├── 📁 helmrepos
    └── kustomization.yaml
```

The `controllers` and `sources` directories have the following sub directories:

#### controllers

- `monitoring`: Monitoring controllers
- `network`: Network controllers
- `upgrade`: Upgrade controllers

#### sources

- `bucket`: [Buckets](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/source/buckets/)
- `git`: [GitRepositories](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/source/gitrepositories/)
- `oci`: [OCIRepositories](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/source/ocirepositories/)
- `helmrepos`: [HelmRepositories](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/source/helmrepositories/)

## Quickstart

Getting started is easy, the following guide uses GitHub as a Git server.

#### Prerequisites

- A (preferably clean) Kubernetes cluster that does not have Flux installed, can be any distribution. For local testing you can use something like [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/), [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/), [microk8s](https://microk8s.io/), etc.
- [age](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age) for secret keys.
- [sops](https://github.com/getsops/sops) for encrypting secrets.
- [just](https://github.com/casey/just) for commands.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for a containerized work environment.

1. [Create a new Git repository by using this one as a template](https://github.com/new?template_name=flux-template&template_owner=418Coffee).

2. Create an age key that will be used for encrypting cluster based secrets:

```sh
age-keygen -o flux.agekey
```

Add the age secret key string (identity) `AGE-SECRET-KEY-1...` found in the file to the default identities file `~/.config/sops/age/keys.txt`.

3. Fill [`config.yaml`](https://github.com/418Coffee/flux-template/blob/main/config.yaml) with your age public key (recipient) and your controller values.

4. Add and encrypt the kubeconfig file:

You can choose to use a different age key to encrypt the kubeconfig (this key will not be pushed to the cluster). Make sure that the identity also exists in the default identities file (`~/.config/sops/age/keys.txt`).

```sh
sops -e -i --age age... --encrypted-regex '^client-key-data$' --input-type yaml --output-type yaml kubeconfig
config
```

5. Build workspace container:

```sh
just build
```

6. Run workspace container:

```sh
just tools
```

7. Render templates:

```sh
just render
```

8. Create a `flux-system` namespace and create the sops-age secret:

#### Create flux-system namespace:

```sh
kubectl create ns flux-system
```

#### Create sops-age secret:

```sh
cat flux.agekey | kubectl create secret generic sops-age \
   --namespace=flux-system \
   --from-file=age.agekey=/dev/stdin
```

9. Bootstrap Flux:

Generate a [GitHub PAT](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens) that can create repositories by checking all permissions under `repo`.

#### Export values:

```sh
export GITHUB_TOKEN=<your-token>
export GITHUB_USER=<your-username>
export GITHUB_REPO=<your-repo>
```

#### Bootstrap:

```sh
flux bootstrap github \
 --components-extra=image-reflector-controller,image-automation-controller \
 --owner=$GITHUB_USER \
 --repository=$GITHUB_REPO \
 --branch=main \
 --path=cluster \
 --read-write-key \
 --personal
```

If you wish to create a public repository, add the --private=false flag.

10. Enjoy your cluster 🎉!

You know have a GitOps compliant cluster fully managed through a Git repository, the sky's the limit 🚀!

## Considerations

**_Why not a monorepo approach?_**

A monorepo is great in theory, dev, staging and prod in one repository with the ability for overlays to minimize duplicated resource declaration. In practice it gets tangled quick, there are a lot of nuances between different environments that can result in more complexity than structure.

**_Why not use X for Y?_**

That's for YOU to decide, this is only meant as a foundation for your own cluster/templates. You can choose to not install any core component and roll with your own.
